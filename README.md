# Guitar Flash Bot

## Description
A bot that plays [Guitar Flash](guitarflash.com) songs. The bot is written in Python using the [`pyautogui`](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

## Setup
Currently, the bot works in 1980x1020 screens. The screen positions have beed adjusted for Micosoft Edge, assuming the root webpage is opened fullscreen without scrolling the page. Should also work for other Chromium-based browsers as long as there are no toolbars, only tabs and URL field. One can then proceed to run the script as long as there is no windows blocking the screen positions where the bot detects chords and clicks.
